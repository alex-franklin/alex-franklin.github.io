            <h2>Preconceptualization</h2>
            <p>Design is a complex and nuanced balance of competing aspects. Of the nearly infinite variable solutions to an existing problem, one truth remains constant: My job is to make it look easy. The end goal is a product that knows what it is, and what it isn't.</p>

			<p>Whether your business is starting up or well established, the fact remains that you need to deliver a specific message to your audience, and consistency in your message is of paramount importance. Be it your website, mailings, advertisements, logo, or cards; everything about your business says a message about you.</p>

			<p><strong>The weakest link among these will carry the most weight among your customers.</strong></p>

			<p>In addition, your message has to actually reach your audience. They may hear your message, but the essential facet is that they listen. It is this goal of engaging customers that drives marketing campaigns.</p>

			<p>Therefore, it is important that your campaigns are focused towards reaching this goal. To understand your business' needs, you need to understand your customer. What are their motivations? What do they value? How do you bring your service or product to their standards? </p>
			<div class="copy_separator"></div>
            <h2>Conceptualization</h2> 
			<p>In the beginning phase of your campaign, it is essential that you answer these questions for yourself and your business, and gather as much information as you can. Using this method, you can proceed every step of the way with the most accurate and complete information of what your marketing is supposed to provide for you.</p>

			<p>Once you've done your homework, together we'll discuss how you expect your marketing piece to reach these expectations. During this meeting we will review branding and message consistency, technological considerations, vendor costs, and sculpt a timeframe for your project. Once we have come to an understanding about our expectations from each other, the vendors, and the project, a proposal will be delivered shortly thereafter. Finally, as costs are agreed upon, an agreement is forged and the work can begin!</p>
            <div class="copy_separator"></div>
            <h2>Visualization</h2>
			<p>Based on the ideas and information gleaned from the Conceptualization process, sketches are drawn up as a preview of the marketing piece. These may take the form of hand-drawn sketches created during the Conceptualization process, or digital mockups delivered to the client at the beginning of the Visualization process.</p>

			<p>After the client receives the mockups, they are reviewed for brand accuracy and aesthetics. The client is then entitled to a number of "revision rounds" agreed upon at the end of conceptualization. The mockup is then worked over according to the specification of the client, and once again presented for revisions.</p>

			<p>When the client is satisfied with the changes, finishing touches are made to create the final marketing piece. Finishing work will vary in time based on the medium of the piece.</p>
            <div class="copy_separator"></div>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
			<p>Depending on the scope and medium of the project, arrangements must be made with various vendors to deliver your message to your audience. Whether a printing and mailing is in order, hosting and/or server technologies provided, or a slot to air on radio or television, the timelines of the project will depend largely on how these vendors can serve you.</p>

			<p>It is up to the client whether they want to handle these arrangements, or delegate the task. Upon completion of the project, the final deliverables are turned over to the vendor for publishing and closing payment is rendered.</p>
