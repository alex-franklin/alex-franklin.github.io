			<h1 title="The Alexander Design Philosophy">The Alexander Design Philosophy</h1>
            <p>Would it be old hat to say that form follows function? Is less <em>really</em> more? Now, more than ever, the answer is yes. In this new technological age, unlimited knowledge is available to <em>everyone</em>. People are more individualized than they were mere decades ago. This matters because it requires you to target your audience more specifically. The age-old fable "You can't please everyone" has never held more truth. Generalizing your audience not only patronizes them, but makes your business look cold and impersonal as well.</p>
			
			<p>In the minds and hearts of your beloved customers, impersonality equates to poor service. In this technical era, customers are looking more and more to personal service as a necessity for an ongoing relationship. Many businesses are stepping up to the plate and launching expansive social networking and text campaigns. The important distinction here is that together, we are designing more than a website, a user interface, or e-newsletter; we are designing a customer experience.</p>

			<p>When you consider your next promotion or campaign, remember that customers listen when you engage them on a personal level. Catering to the masses will only leave your customers feeling detached on an individual basis. At Alexander Design, every effort is planned with the end goal of providing a memorable, personalized experience to your customer that will keep them talking and thinking about you. Don't let your brand be ignored any longer.</p>
